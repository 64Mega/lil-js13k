# Lost In Labyrinth - JS13k 2017 Game
## Quick overview
---

**NOTE**: The game isn't complete. If anything, it's a proof-of-concept and reference point for next year.
Most of the work involved went into the core framework and studying some new (to me) Javascript concepts.

To get the game running on your local dev environment, make sure you have a reasonably up-to-date installation of Node.
You'll also need Gulp and will probably want browser-sync

Run `npm install` in the root directory to install the required gulp plugins.

My workflow is:
```
gulp build && gulp watch
cd build
browser-sync start -s --files *
```

Controls are explained briefly in-game.

A write-up explaining (Or excusing) decisions made during the development process will be made available soon.
